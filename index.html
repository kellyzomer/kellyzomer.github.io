   <p>Hi, my name is Kelly!</p>
</div>

<div class="paragraph2"> 
    <p>I am happy to share my passions and interests with you on this website. Due to my eagerness to learn I have a wide variety of professional and personal interests. My professional interests have evolved over time. I have a bachelor’s in Marketing and Economics. After discovering the world during some of my first backpacking experiences, I became fascinated by the tremendous differences there are between places, cities and countries. This led to a master’s degree in Economic Geography. However, after two years of researching commercial real estate transactions in the Netherlands, it felt inevitable to learn about IT and data. At this job I’ve learned a lot about working with data, but the urge to have a deep understanding of the technical aspects around data led me to my current job as a data engineering consultant.<br><br> 

    In my free time, I like bouldering and climbing, exploring nature, traveling, food and craft beers, and various sports like running, squash, golf and cycling.</p>
