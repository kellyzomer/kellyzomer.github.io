         <p>Hello everyone! I am excited to share my journey with you on this website. I have a passion for learning, and this has led me to explore various interests and careers throughout my life. My background includes a Bachelor's degree in Marketing and Economics, followed by a Master's in Economic Geography. However, my journey took an unexpected turn when I discovered my love for working with data.<br><br>

         Growing up, I was always curious about the world around me and fascinated by the differences between places, cities, and countries. This curiosity led me to pursue a Master's degree in Economic Geography, where I had the opportunity to research commercial real estate transactions in the Netherlands. Although I enjoyed the work, I found myself drawn to the technical aspects of data and how it could be used to solve problems.<br><br>

         In my free time, I enjoy outdoor activities such as bouldering and climbing, exploring nature and traveling. My fasciniation for the world around me resulted in amazing (solo) backpacking trips around te world. Furthermore, I do various sports like running, squash and cycling. I also have a love for craft beers and I like to expore new foods.</p>
