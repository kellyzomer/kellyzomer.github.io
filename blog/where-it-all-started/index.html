   <h2>Where IT all started</h2>
   <p> 
      Before I started working in technology, I had never considered it as something that would interest me or even as a possible career choice. My background was rooted in social sciences, and I had literally no experience or knowledge of programming or computers. However, when I completed my master's degree in economic geography, I was introduced to the world of technology and data, and it totally blew my mind! With such a vast range of topics in data and IT, I jumped right in and spent two months in a training program to figure out what I liked best. The more I learned about data and IT, the more I wanted to know (I'm always like that haha!). I find it super exciting to gain new skills and knowledge!
   </p>

      During my training program, I learned a lot about data, but I also wanted to improve my personal digital life. So, I did the first thing that came to mind and bought my own domain name, kellyzomer.com. Then, I set up a Google Workspace account, which allowed me to start fresh without all the spam that had piled up in my old email account for the last fifteen years or so (haha, that’s a long time, but it’s true. I have created this old mail address to use MSN Messenger a very long time ago). The happiness I feel when my mailbox is organized like this is priceless to me.
   </p>

      To keep my new email and existing accounts safe, I switched from iCloud keychain to a new password manager (1Password). My mom and I wanted a simple way to share access to our digital lives in case of emergencies, so this password manager even has a printable key that we can share with our emergency contacts. It's like killing two birds with one stone!
   </p>

   <p>
      Furthermore, I learned about "catch-all" email addresses. It's awesome because I can create a different email address for every website I visit. This way, if I ever get spam, I can figure out which website sold my info or got their database breached. Plus, my significant other and I use it for fun too! We create silly email addresses like fitgirlcouplegoals@ or saturdayafternoonspending@ and forward mails to each other. I am aware of only one problem with my setup. My emails are getting marked as spam by my friends' Microsoft accounts, even though I've set up the DKIM and SPF correctly. But that's just a new challenge for me to tackle in the near future!
   </p>

   <p>
      I didn't just get that domain name for a new email account, I had bigger plans in mind! My goal was to learn web development by building my own website from scratch using HTML and CSS, instead of using pre-made templates. My significant other helped me along the way. I signed up for Github and hosted my website on GitHub pages, as well as downloaded Sublime Text to create HTML and CSS files. This learning experience was enjoyable and it helped me understand how syntax works and see the results of my code right away. Even though I was new to it, I found learning the basics of HTML and CSS relatively easy, thanks to the abundance of online documentation available.
   </p>

      If you're new to the tech and data world, I think it's a good idea to know the fundamentals of web development and Git. When I started my new job working with the Azure stack, I was happy that I already had some experience using Git since Azure DevOps uses it too. I used Git in the command line interface and was advised to take an online course to learn how to use the CLI better. Even though my coworkers thought it was unnecessary to learn the CLI, I found it super helpful when I worked on a data-related project that required Docker. Thanks to the advice I got, I was able to rock the CLI!

      After setting up my website, new email address, and password manager, I looked for ways to further improve my digital life. I decided to start using the Google Calendar app to connect everything in my workspace. Sharing my schedule with my significant other helped avoid logistical issues when planning events with friends weeks in advance. This was just a small adjustment, but it works great for me. It's interesting how starting a job in data inspired me to rearrange my digital life. When my digital space is clear, I have more headspace for other work-related and personal stuff.
